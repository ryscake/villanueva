Library Management System

This Library Management System is a Python-based application that allows users to manage books through a simple console interface. It demonstrates the use of various Python keywords by incorporating them into functional operations like adding, borrowing, returning, and displaying books. Additional functionalities include checking book details using a book ID, using lambda functions, and generating book IDs with a generator.

Features

Add Books: Users can add new books by providing a title and an author.

Borrow Books: Allows users to borrow books using the title.

Return Books: Enables users to return borrowed books.

Display Books: Lists all available books in the library.

Check Book ID: Users can check the status of a book by entering its ID.

Book Title Lengths: Uses a lambda function to calculate and display the length of book titles.

Generate Book IDs: A generator function displays available book IDs.

Python Keywords Used

The following Python keywords are used in the program:

and, or, not: Used for logical operations in borrowing and returning books.

as, except, try, finally: Used for exception handling when checking book IDs.

assert: Ensures input validation for title and author data.

break, continue: Applied for flow control in loops.

class: Implements the Library class to manage book data.

def, return: Defines functions and returns values.

del: Used to manage book data (future enhancement).

elif, else, if: Handles conditional logic for user input choices.

False, True: Tracks book status (borrowed or available).

for, while: Utilized for looping through books and managing the menu.

from, import: Facilitates module imports if necessary.

global: Declares a global variable for the library name.

in, is: Checks membership and identity in book operations.

lambda: Creates anonymous functions for calculating title lengths.

None: Represents a missing or unassigned value.

nonlocal: (Not applied, but available for nested functions).

pass: Used as a placeholder in code.

raise: Can be applied for error generation in future updates.

with: (Not applied but can be used for file operations).

yield: Generates book IDs for available books.

Example Usage

Add a Book: Enter the title and author of a book to add it to the library.

Borrow a Book: Select the book by its title if it's available.

Return a Book: Mark a borrowed book as returned.

Check Book ID: Enter a book ID to see its details.

Lambda Example: Displays the length of each book title.

Generate Book IDs: Lists available book IDs using a generator.

Exit: End the program.

This Library Management System is a practical example of how Python keywords can be used to create a functional application. Enjoy managing your library!
